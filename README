Simple tool to generate a static listing of a directory, similarly to what web
servers like Apache and lighthttpd offer. Can be used to host directories on
static hosting sites such as Github Pages or Netlify.

You can obtain the binary version of this software via:
$ curl -sf https://goblin.reaper.im/github.com/lucat1/statik | sh
Or any other compliant service such as https://gobinaries.com/.

A list of customization opitons can be found by looking at the program's help.
